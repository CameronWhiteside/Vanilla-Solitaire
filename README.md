# Vanilla Solitaire

Live Site

This was an independent project created to utilize the HTML5 Drag and Drop API. The application was designed with minimal JavaScript and isdesigned to mimic a tabletop game of single-draw solitare. Placement logic has been minimized so that users can explore their own version of the classic card game.
